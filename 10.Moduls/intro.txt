Module - every .py file is a module
package - is a group of modules for eg 5 modules under 1 folder AND there should be an empty file __init__.py file - this is mandatory.
Library -  is a collection or a group of packages.


eg numpy, pandas, etc are libraries 
sys, os, time, math - modules 

file1.py
sum(),sub(),var1,var2

file2.py
mul(), div(), var3, var4

multiple syntax to do this in file2.py
a. import file1
all the contents of file1 are imported and can be used inside file2. 

file1.sum()

import file1 as f1 
f1.sum()

the above is not a very efficiemnt way of doing the same, as we are only using sum() but we get all sub(),var1,var2 and we dont need them.

b. from file1 import sum() 
now yo dont need file1. notation, rather use directly sum()
