files are used to store data
typical size of the files are 20mb, 1gb, 100gb.

beyond normal size or storage, we goto DB
RDBMS

Python will automatically close the file connection for you.
BUT we are going to learn that in the last. you will be using it while working.

modes in file handling.
14 modes in file handling
text file or log files

modes:
r - read a file, and if the files doesnt exists - it will give us an error that FileNotFoundError
w - write to a file,and if the files doesnt exists - it will create a new file and if it exists it will "overrrite".
a - append to a file(similar to w except if the files exisits it will append at the end of file EOF)
r+ - read and write
w+ - write and read
a+ - append and read 
x - exclusive mode - based o file system handling

same 7 in binary mode and it changes to b 
rb - read a file, and if the files doesnt exists - it will give us an error that fileDoesntExists
wb - write to a file,and if the files doesnt exists - it will create a new file and if it exists it will "overrrite".
ab - append to a file(similar to w except if the files exisits it will append at the end of file EOF)
rb+ - read and write
wb+ - write and read
ab+ - append and read 
xb - exclusive mode - based o file system handling


steps
Step 1: Create a connection to the file that you want to access or write to it or read from it.
Step 2: File operations/handling based on your requirements.
Step 3: clise the connection or the file obj pointer -- vvvvvvvvvv imp for interviews.

how do we open a connection to the file
using the open()
