# The whole logic with the condition is utilized in a "single" line.

a=400
b=400

if a > b: print("A is greater of the two") # shortened version of the if and it works only for one single condition but this is NOT shorthand if

# remmeber for shorthand if we cannot use :

# shorthand if

print("A is greater than B ") if a > b else print("Both are equal") if a == b else print("B is greater than A")
